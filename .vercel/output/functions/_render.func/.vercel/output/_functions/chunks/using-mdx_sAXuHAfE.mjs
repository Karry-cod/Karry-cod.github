If you prefer not to use MDX, you can disable support by removing the integration from your config file.\r\n\r\n## Why MDX?\r\n\r\nMDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.\r\n\r\nIf you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration will hopefully make migrating to Astro a breeze.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nHere is how you import and use a UI component inside of MDX.  \r\nWhen you open this page in the browser, you should see the clickable button below.\r\n\r\n## More Links\r\n\r\n- [MDX Syntax Documentation](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx)\r\n- [Astro Usage Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#markdown-and-mdx-pages)\r\n- **Note:** [Client Directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) are still required to create interactive components. Otherwise, all components in your MDX will render as static HTML (no JavaScript) by default.\r\n";
